* Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.


##Overview
For this assignment, you will be building the front-end of a private car a la ride sharing service. Most of you will be passengers. A lucky few of you, randomly selected, will be drivers / vehicles. I cannot provide you the number of passengers or drivers. The idea: passengers will be seeking vehicles, drivers will be seeking customers (passengers). You will develop a web page that:

1. Retrieves your current location (latitude and longitude) and sends it to a server via ride request API that I created.
2. Retrieves and displays the locations of vehicles OR passengers on a map, depending on who you are. Your web page will need to handle both cases (showing locations of vehicles or passengers on map) as it is possible that I can change your status from a passenger to a driver, vice versa.
3. Upon clicking on your marker (i.e., where you are currently located), show how far away you are to (1) the nearest vehicle or passenger --depending on who you are, and (2) the Weinermobile --if it exists!
