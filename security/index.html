	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>The product that I am testing today is a server-side, web application hosted on heroku that uses the Node.js and Express web frameworks.The server is supposed to maintain and serve locations of passengers and vehicles (with username, latitutde, and longitude) for a long period of time. The server uses a MongoDB to store the data.</p>
	<p>I was hired to find and document any security vulnerabilities that I was able to locate in the web application. These may include, but are not limited to, database injection, XSS, or bad programming practices.
