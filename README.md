# comp20-cholley


## Purpose
This repository contains some of the work that I've completed for comp20 assignments. It is a way for me to learn and interact with git, but also allows an administrator to see my progress through commits and final product remotely. Each of the folders represent a different assignment or lab.

## Favorite Lab or Assignment
My favorite tasks this semester were assignments 2 and 3. If I had to chose between the two, I would probably go with assignment 3 just because after completing it I felt like I had a full-circle understanding of basics of under-the-hood web programming. I also really liked working with the express and node.js frameworks because I'm working on my own web-programming project, and I know I'll be using those two frameworks. It was also really cool to be introduced to heroku, and getting introduced to deploying our own server. Assignemnt 3 felt very "real" to me, and it was cool to see how relatively simple it is build and deploy our own server.

## Growth
Having only taken comp11 and comp15 in the CS department, I really knew nothing about web-programming. It was like this dark beast that I knew existed but frightened me because I understood absolutely nothing about it. Now, not only do I have the confidence to be able entertain a conversation, but I've learned how to fully implement my own web app.

## Most Important Learning Objective
The most important thing I learned is how to create my own programming project. In comp11 and comp15 you learn programming practices, algorithms, and data structures, but you don't learn how to build a product. Now, I can create my own project to put on a resume.

Example 1 - Nextjump - At the career fair the employers working there said that without a project to showcase, your chances of getting hired are nill.
Example 2 - https://www.computerscience.org/resources/jobs-in-computer-science/ : "Related hobbies and side projects that use your skills are important in the industry. Employers want to see that you’re passionate about your work and that you’re driven to accomplish new things with your skills."

## Topic to Learn More About
Honestly, all types of different frameworks to help make life easier. It's great to understand the fundamentals, but now I want to see the power of some of the frameworks (python frameworks specifically) and what they can do.
